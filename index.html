<h2> Looking for 3 months work experience from May 12, 2021 ! </h2>
<p>
I would love to work in the luxury and fashion sector. That is why I am looking for an internship in this environment.  </br>
</p>
<p>
Born of an English father and a French mother, and having spent most of my schooling in a bilingual environment, I am able to adapt easily  and I am therefore looking forward for my future with a thorough knowledge of English and an open mind.</p>
<p>
My internships allowed me to learn the art of negotiation and sales.They gave me maturity and a sense of responsibility. </p>
<p>
Finally, I had the chance to do a humanitarian mission in Nepal which consolidated my interest in human relations. It was a unique experience that took me out of my comfort zone. Since my return, I have continued my involvement as a young ambassador for UNICEF. I am committed to the realization of projects and I particularly appreciate teamwork. </p>
<p>
	I hope I have shared my enthusiasm with you !
